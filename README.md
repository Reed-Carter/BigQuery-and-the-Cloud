## Description

This is series of visualizations made from FitBit data which displays the step count vs calories burned. The dataset was downloaded from kaggle which was generated by respondents to a distributed survey via Amazon Mechanical Turk between 03.12.2016-05.12.2016. Thirty eligible Fitbit users consented to the submission of personal tracker data output for step count, calories burned,heart rate, and sleep monitoring. The visualizations have drill down capabilities therefore, data for each individual id can be selected using the id_table and the step count and calories burned will update to be specific to that particular id. The pie chart also has drill down capabilities. Therefore the data visualization can be queried to only display data for a particular month by selecting the desired month on the pie chart.
